# Face-detection-using-Open-CV
This project implements real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures frames from a webcam, converts them to grayscale, and detects faces using a pre-trained Haar cascade model. The detected faces are outlined with bounding boxes, and the system provides live feedback.
